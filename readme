aggregations are criteria for querries in json format.
aggregations are used to do calculations...
Pipelines are a series of aggreagation and stages and they can be in form of arrays
when sorting db."collection name".find().sort({"key":1/-1}(for ascending or descending respectively))(use 1 for ascending order and -1 for descending order)
